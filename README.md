## Description

This is a Broadway themed quiz game that was created to provide entertainment and test a user's Broadway knowledge. This game works as follows:

- Starting timer of 90secs (1:30)
- Each correct answer progresses the quiz
- Each incorrect answer deducts 10secs from the timer
- Quiz ends when each questions is correctly answered OR if the timer hits 0
- Quiz is scored as 1 point for each remaining second on the timer

The user is then able to enter their initials and scores into the High Scores page.
